1. Review and approve minutes from [2024-02-06 meeting](2024-02-06-minutes.md)
2. NDR reorganization.  Some [thoughts and open questions](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/issues/41#issuecomment-1932876619):
   1. Do we want to write mappings for metamodel to XSD and metamodel to CMF? Or do we want the metamodel to just be informative documentation? There are about a dozen NDRs that can be expressed once at the metamodel level, if we write the mappings. But we might want to reiterate them in the XNDR anyway.
   2. What must be part of NDR 6.0 PS01? What can wait until later?
   3. Is the title still *Naming and Design Rules*, or something else?
   4. One document, or several?

3. List other necessary tasks, and prioritize
4. New business
