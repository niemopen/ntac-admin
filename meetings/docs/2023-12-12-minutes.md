## Previous minutes

Minutes for the [2023-11-28 meeting](2023-11-28-minutes.md) approved without change.

## Structures errata

* *structures.xsd* is missing `structures:appliesToParent` in type definitions and attribute groups ([issue #96]([structures:appliesToParent errata · Issue #96 · niemopen/niem-model (github.com)](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-model/issues/96)))
* Jim: don't wait too long to publish the errata
* Steve to ask Kelly what's entailed.  Jim says not too onerous.

## OASIS standard

Steve:  CMFTool and MEP Builder probably count as uses

Jim: how to package the 6.0 release

jim: need NDR and tooling in place before OASIS standardization

Steve:  prepare to explain position at next PGB meeting (Jan 25th)

## NIEM implementation cookbook

* https://github.com/NIEM/Implementation-Cookbook/wiki 
* Apparently not updated since 2015

* Needs updating – if it's worth maintaining?
* TBD after NDR and tooling

adjourned at 1022
