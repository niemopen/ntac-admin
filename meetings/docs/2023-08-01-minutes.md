## NIEM 6 stuff

* *Resolved:*  Namespace URIs use HTTPS, end in slash, don't have hash
  *Resolved:*  NIEM model URIs include "model"
  Example: https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/niem-core/6.0/
  We are probably done with this at last!
* *Resolved*: Update CTAS with new OASIS-style namespace URI as part of NIEM 6.0 version.
  Will be https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/specification/conformanceTargets/3.0/
