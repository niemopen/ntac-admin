## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2024-10-15 meeting](2024-10-15-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## NDR rewrite
- Section 3 revisions were discussed
  - Improved!

  - Message format includes a message schema.  Does it include anything else?  Yes, a simple format would include mappings from canonical names (`nc:PersonName`) to short names (`name`).  Look at [Complex Message Specification](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/blob/main/examples/src/ComplexMSpec) example.

  - Message type includes a message model; anything else? Yes, a message type must specify the root element (for XML) or at least the root type (for JSON).

  - There are TODOs pointing to rules for messag formats and types.

- Attribute augmentation
  - Must keep subset rule.  (It doesn't appear in NDR5, but will appear in NDR6.)
  - Must not inherit attribute wildcards from structures in a message schema.  Will have rule to that effect.

- Status
  - 2024-10-21 draft revised all of section 4 except augmentations (4.15). Ready for review.
  - Dr. Scott is revising sections 6, 9, 11 next.

- Deadline
  - Seven weeks left.
  - Need faster review tempo.  Can't wait until Tuesday!  Send comments via the mailing list, etc.
