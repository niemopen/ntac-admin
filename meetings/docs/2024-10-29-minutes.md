## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2024-10-22 meeting](2024-10-22-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## NTAC co-chair

* Scott Renner was elected as liason to PGB.
* Brad Bollinger was elected as NTAC co-chair, replacing Jim Cabral.

## NDR rewrite

* Should we add properties to the Model object in the metamodel?
  * Model metadata, things like author, title, things that appear now in the *iepd-catalog.xml* file in the IEPD specification from NIEM 5.
  * Consider this for NDR 6.0 PS2+ next calendar year.
* Concrete examples in section 3.4 would be helpful.
* `xs:restriction` has always been allowed in extension schema documents.  Does it add anything useful?  Perhaps remove from NDR 6.  Decide soon.
* PropertyAssociation becomes Child PropertyAssociations, and we will speak of "child properties of a class".
