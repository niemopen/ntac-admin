## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2024-12-17 meeting](2024-12-17-minutes.md) were appoved without change.

## NDR rewrite

Some last-minute fixes to PSD01:

* Need a rule like 12-2 for JSON messages.  They must conform to the message type and be valid against a message format schema

* An element with xsi:nil="true" must be a reference to an object (and have structures:ref or structures:uri)

* Replace "grammar production" with "grammar syntax"

* There is a broken reference link at rule 3-1

* Add a paragraph to section 2 pointing to training materials that will be available at niemopen.org
