## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2024-11-12 meeting](2024-11-12-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## NDR rewrite

* Move section 5 (modeling patterns) before section 4 (metamodel & CMF)?
  * No, but move most of 4.15 (augmentation) examples to section 5

* Section 3.2 could distinguish specialization (new subclass) from augmentation (additional properties)
* Section 3.6 could include the [Augmentation Elements | NIEM GitHub](https://urldefense.us/v2/url?u=https-3A__niem.github.io_reference_concepts_augmentation_element_&d=DwMF-g&c=Al8V6E3U0yBSSEuVtdZbGtsvjPA49U3WmtZAsdW0D_Q&r=ZM6yFL4cNV2bF3fyeJ0QYg&m=aUDdpQherZGOteW5v5f6axpnjzKU5j5tI_Qawt5n9tTq16rBkho_euQILFqtiHMI&s=hFokaHpDCM2GYgnUcJYSbVyaNDfzJotOWs7WZcvQ_ZI&e=) diagram

## Punchlist

* Schematron rules
  * Testing old and new schematron rules against model, CMF
  * Updating the URIs
  * Fix anything that breaks on the 6.0 model

## Literals

* Long discussion on atomic classes and literal properties

* Different RDF depending on model subsets - this seems bad

* Alternative approach based on NIEM 5 JSON specification, using `rdf:value`

* Christina to provide examples for further discussion

## New business

* Last week we noted “Enterprise Model - the idea of organization-specific definitions that can extend or restrict NIEM "real life things" for possible future discussion.”

* Mike Hulme provided link to relevant NTAC paper:   [business-information-exchange-components-1.0.pdf](https://reference.niem.gov/niem/guidance/business-information-exchange-components/1.0/business-information-exchange-components-1.0.pdf)
