## NDR Overhaul and Technical Issues

- Revisions to sections 9, 10, 11 of NDR are available for review in the [dev branch of the NDR repo](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/tree/dev).

## New business

* *Resolved:* NTAC will recommend that NBAC sync the version number of the justice domain to 6.0

  * https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/domains/jxdm/6.0/
  * *not* https://docs.oasis-open.org/niemopen/ns/model/domains/jxdm/8.2/
  * @version attribute can still be "8.2"

* While revising NDR we will maintain a map of old NDR rule numbers to new NDR rule numbers.

* We will generate NDR schematron files from the NDR markdown source.
