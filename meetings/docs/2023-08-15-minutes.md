## Previous minutes

[Minutes for 2023-08â€“08](2023-08-08-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## NDR Overhaul

- Tom Carlson is removing XML Schema terms from the JSON binding, replacing with CMF where needed
- Scott Renner is working on NDR sections 9, 10, & 11

## Technical Issues

- [Attribute augmentation and metadata replacement](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/blob/main/examples/src/Augmentation/README.md)
  - Christina Medlin observes that the proposal still does allow two ways to augment complex content with an element (augmentation point or reference attribute).
  - No immediate push-back on removing metadata mechanism from NIEM 6; still needs thought
  - Tooling (SSGT) will need to change to reflect re: simple types
  - Example 8 doesn't currently work
- [NIEM models in XSD and CMF (#64)](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/discussions/64)
  - Roll with this for now
- [Remove `structures:AssociationType`? (NDR#36)](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/issues/36)
  - Dropping this one for now
