## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2026-01-06 meeting](2026-01-06-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## Old business

### Code list bindings

Discussed and closed two previous issues regarding code list bindings in CMF. See [CMF issue #15](https://github.com/niemopen/common-model-format/issues/15).

### Augmentations in XML and JSON

XML schema allows for controlling the cardinality of each property in augmentations, the JSON schema does not maintain this control, leading to all properties becoming required in every instance. Jim proposed a workaround to relax the cardinality, but this would impact both JSON and XML schemas. Dr. Scott suggested maintaining the augmentations and replacing them with a choice structure similar to the XML message schemas.  See [CMFTool issue #29](https://github.com/niemopen/cmftool/issues/29).
