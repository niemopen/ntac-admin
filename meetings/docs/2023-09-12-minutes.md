## NDR Overhaul and Technical Issues

- *Resolved:*  We will change the version number in the URI for the Conformance Target Attributes Specification to `6.0`.  Then it will align with the other specification URIs.  We will need to publish a new version of the CTAS project specification when we publish the other 6.0 releases.

* New revisions to the NDR in the [dev branch](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/tree/dev) are available for review.  Start with the [changelog](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/blob/dev/changelog.md).
* Dave Kemp described NIST work relevant to NIEM 7:

  - NIST Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) [https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/)
  - Specified using NIST Metaschema Information Modeling Framework [https://pages.nist.gov/metaschema/](https://pages.nist.gov/metaschema/)
  - With example OSCAL information Models at [https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/src/metaschema](https://github.com/usnistgov/OSCAL/tree/main/src/metaschema)
