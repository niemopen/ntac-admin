## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2025-01-07 meeting](2025-01-07-minutes.md) were not available for review.

## New business

* Brad Bolliger suggests a discussion of cross-COI development next week
  * Steve Sullivan recommends including DHS; they span 8 domain
  *  Potential for cross-model alignment between NIEM and HL7, or MilOps alignment to Army standard
  *  Mike Hulme asking about role of NBAC in such discussions, also a good item for discussion

* Vote for NDS PSD01, commences MLK Day, should be completed by EOW (Jan 24)
  * Steve discussing with Kelly if we will need to have another PS draft, rather than proceeding with the same PS and include updates from PSD01
  * NTAC expects we can proceed with including updates directly without need for a new Draft

* Training:
  * Darcy would like to jump on the NIEM 6 training, as we've had some request from the MilOps members. Perhaps they could serve as "beta training" testers from a webinar scenario.
  * Shunda and Darcy to coordinate that with Tom and Chuck

* Reviewed [discussion paper on message specifications](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/blob/main/documents/docs/N6MsgSpec-220802.docx)
* Reviewed Schematron rules for NDR6
  * NDR5 rules converted to NDR6; mostly automated
  * May be useful for someone to write some test cases for those rules, so valid schema passes but invalid schema failes
  * Also may be useful for someone to test in something other than Oxygen
