Minutes from the [2025-06-10 meeting](2025-06-10-minutes.md) and the [2025-06-17 meeting](docs/2025-06-17-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## New business

* NIEMOpen's contract with GTRI is in progress

* NDR Section 14 (Interpretation of NIEM data) is ready for review

* NTAC to take another look at [Cardinality constraints for properties (2025-05-26)](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/blob/main/documents/docs/PropertyConstraints-250526.md).  In this proposal, local types appear only in the validation message schemas â€“ which are already non-conforming.  There are only global definitions and declarations in the conforming schemas that represent models.
