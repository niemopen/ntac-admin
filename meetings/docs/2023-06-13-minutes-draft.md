### NDR Overhaul

- [NDR Principles discussion board](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/discussions/38)
- "What's New" document
	- Called "NIEM 6.0 Architectural Changes Project Note"
	- https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/blob/main/project-notes/docs/niem-6.0-arch-changes/niem-6.0-arch-changes-v1.0-pn01.md
- `nc:ObjectType` not in there yet, okay to add? (See discussion below.)
- Metadata applicability to parent section, does it go away?
- Removing `structures:@sequenceID` for `OrderedPropertyIndicator`, default is unordered
	- apply by modifying user schemas
		- goes on the element `ref`
		- need to add to the tooling
	- Do we still need something for names?
	- Should that be something the message spec developer adds to meet their needs?
	- (See earlier discussions below)
- [ ] All, review this week to decide whether to publish next week
- what do we call a complex type with simple content?
	- [[Jim Cabral]] call it "complex type with simple content"
	- [[Christina Medlin|CM]] "complex value type"

### CMFTool

- How to constrain different things of the same type?

	- CMF doesn't have that
	- Can do at the XML/JSON Schema level
	- Would have to greatly complicate CMF in order to replicate this simplification
	- Push direct CMF support to NIEM 7.0


## NDR and External Standards

Proposal to allow NIEM to incorporate other standards by reference, in addition to the current inclusion via adapters

- Not much demand for JSON standards in the past, but now is building, e.g. [[STIX]]

Issues/Feature Requests:

1.  Adding support for external JSON standards, including JSON adapters.
2.  Adding support for linked data between JSON and XML NIEM-conforming messages
3.  Enabling contributors to submit suggest content in a JSON format

[[Jim Cabral]] Shouldn't these requirements come from the NBAC?
[[Scott Renner|Dr. Scott]] For JSON standards, it'll be palatable, take their standard, turn into CMF, spit out XSD

[[Tom Carlson]] Three levels?

1. Convert and incorporate
2. Connect with adapters
3. Reference, no validation

#resolved Kick this to the NBAC for their feedback on the requirements and priority, [[Christina Medlin|CM]] to bring to them

### `nc:ObjectType`?

https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/discussions/58

Need a universal base type for ISM attributes. Add `ObjectType` into niem-core so it can get into the CMF without including `structures` itself? (Because `structures` is XML-specific plumbing.)

[[Christina Medlin|CM]] Could make it a conformant type?
[[Jim Cabral]] Big change that impacts everything, so we need a _really good_ reason to make the change.

- Need 2, `ObjectType` and `AssociationType`
- Assoc is already in niem-core
- ObjectType just contains the aug point
	- Which won't show up in JSON, as it doesn't do the abstracts
- Still in `structures`
	- `MetadataType`
		- [[Christina Medlin|CM]] Need to figure this out for the What's New
		- [[Scott Renner|Dr. Scott]] First draft can go out without this
	- `AugmentationType`

### `@sequenceID`

Which is the default? Ordered or unordered?
[[David Kemp|Dave Kemp]]: JSON arrays are ordered.
[[Christina Medlin|CM]]: We've flip-flopped on this
[[Jim Cabral]]: Need a means of ordering, regardless of which we pick.

What's the original rationale for this? It's an XML kludge. Doesn't work well in RDF.

[[Christina Medlin|CM]]: Name ordering needs the attribute, because the ordering can change.
[[Scott Renner|Dr. Scott]]: Display order is something you model.
