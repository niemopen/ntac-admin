## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2024-08-27 meeting](2024-08-27-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## NDR rewrite
- Scott Renner spoke about problems in model design – adding to your model subset overwrites the model customizations.  Better tooling can fix this
- Cursory review from Tom Carlson
  - In general, perhaps not enough explanation
  - For example, doesn't explain purpose of augmentations

- For next week
  - Conformance targets will change a bit – wait for next draft before reviewing these.
  - Consider how rules might be simplified – possibly by combining related rules that are presently separate for ease of Schematron programming.
  - Consider which rules need more explanation
