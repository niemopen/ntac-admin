## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2024-09-03 meeting](2024-09-03-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## NDR rewrite
- Status
  - Conformance targets revised in latest draft.
  - Rules will be revised and reordered in next draft.
  - Also postprocessing for rule numbers and links, like that for defined terms.

- The OASIS style uses `<h6>` for references.  Can we use `<h6>` for rules and definitions?
  - That would give us working links in the markdown source.
  - Scott Renner:  I don't really need those links to work when editing the source.
  - We would still need some postprocessing for defined terms.

- Wildcards
  - NIEM 5 permits xs:any and xs:anyAttribute in extension schema documents
  - CMF does not yet have a way to represent these wildcards in extension namespaces.

- Remaining products for NIEM 6:
  - NDR6
  - Message specification guidance
  - Code list specification
  - Conformance specification
  - Conformance target assertion specification
  - NIEM Model 6.0 PS02
  - CMF specification
