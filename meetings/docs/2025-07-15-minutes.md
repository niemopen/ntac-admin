## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2025-07-08 meeting](2025-07-08-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## New business

* What about niem.gov?
  * DOD can't afford to maintain; DHS wants to decommission the site
  * Move content from .gov to .org site
  * We really don't want to lose that content
  * perhaps preserve some redirects (eg. reference.niem.gov)
* What about SSGT?
  * GTRI runs that
  * Should not turn off until we have a working replacement
  * Can MEPBuilder generate subsets?
* What about old model versions in our repo?
  * Currently available as zip files
  * Seems good enough
* NDR 6.0 PS reviews
  * Needs some RDF expert review
  * Fix relationship property example.  The secret should be the Clark Kent relationship (Superman's secret identity)
