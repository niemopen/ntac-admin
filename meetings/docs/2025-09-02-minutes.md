## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2025-08-26 meeting](2025-08-26-minutes.md) were not available.

## New business

* Also waiting for Christina to submit a 3rd SOU
* Request the approval of the model and NDR separately, unless Kelly believes they can be combined
  - Further requests will require going before the PGB again; if we can put that together as a single candidate oasis standard submission, would be ideal
  - Request for OASIS standard can begin soon; Stephen to walk Brad or Paul through procedure
  - Will not have the luxury of Stephen’s assistance after September; NTAC will need to figure out who will take responsibility for running the meetings
  - Create a secretary or scheduler
  - No reason that that responsibility will need to be borne by co-chairs, but is often the case.
* Jennifer Stathakis thanks Jim Cabral and Scott Renner for their presentation on the use NIEM and applications of standards; tools generated a lot of interest among the community
* Paul expresses concern about the messaging relating to DOD’s departure as NMO; this is an expected part of the NIEMOpen process as the leadership transitions. This is a natural transition, and should not impede OASIS Open Standard process or ISO process. Future of NIEMOpen is bright, with DOD, DHA, and other agencies involvement in NIEMOpen.
 
* NTAC also looking for secretary
  - Also looking to recruit new folks, particularly developers, who can help with model development considering new domains, tool development, and NDR updates going forward
  - Grateful to be re-engaging GTRI
  - Also looking for more support in addition to GTRI, as noted, in future as well
* Voting:
  - NDR and NIEM 6.0 SOU approved
  - Vote to approve as Candidate OASIS Standards - 60-day review, currently in progress
* Oct 8 meeting
  - Reiterating request to attend in each NTAC meeting
  - Otherwise planning the NTAC goals, and plenary agenda
* Nov 13 webinar
  - Demo prep underway
