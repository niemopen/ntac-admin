## Previous minutes

Minutes from the [2024-11-05 meeting](2024-11-05-minutes.md) were approved without change.

## NDR rewrite

* **Decided:** No xs:restriction allowed in NDR 6 PSD01
  * It's a lot of work in CMFTool; can't be done this calendar year

  * We can put it back if the reviewers really want it

* **Decided:**  Revise rule about XSD comments
  * Replace SHOULD with MAY

  * Add warning note that comments aren't preserved or used by tooling

* **Decided:** Put copyright notice into 2nd `xs:documentation` element in NIEM model XSD
  * Also have link to the LICENSE.md file in repo
  * Prefer no comment block at start of XSD, but OK if OASIS needs it


* **Decided:** Don't talk about initial node in section 3.1, instead talk about initial property, w. forward ref to section 3.4
* Fix section 3.4 diagram; remove class/property relationship
* Christina NDR punchlist
  * NDR5 says EXT CCC types can use xs:choice as a child of xs: sequence
    Idea is to use it as a child property of sequence; choice group for similar elements, like personeyecolorcode or personeyecolortext.
    Why not substitution? Must own the property to set its substitition group.

  * Nillable: NDR5 says elements in EXT schemas can set attribute nillable to false
    NDR6 says no, do that in subset schema instead

  * Wildcards: EXT CCC types can use xs:any and anyAttribute - Scott to fix

  * Augmentation point element uses in CCC can have any cardinality

* NDR punchlist:
  * adapters

  * roles

  * metadata


## New business:

* David Kemp liked “Enterprise Model - the idea of organization-specific definitions that can extend or restrict NIEM "real life things"
  * Remember for possible future discussion.”
