## New business

* Requesting review of Dr Scottâ€™s Self-Describing Message paper; RDF entailments and Cardinality constraints may be discussed in future.

* MilOps domain looking for technical resource support for 14 August and 9 October

  o  Use cases presented at each meeting, recently have had a technical question and would like an NTAC member to support.

  o  If there is anyone able to provide technical answers during our bi-monthly (every two months) MilOps subcommittee meeting, we would welcome your expertise. We are sorely missing our friend and colleague, Chuck Chipman!

  o   The next meetings are 14 August & 9 October. (We do not have a meeting in December.) Here is the meeting info:
