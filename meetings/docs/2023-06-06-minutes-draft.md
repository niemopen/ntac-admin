## NDR and External Standards

- Proposal to allow NIEM to incorporate other standards by reference, in addition to the current inclusion via adapters
- Not much demand for JSON standards in the past, but now is building, e.g. STIX
	- Need JSON adapters?
- Is there now a need to incorporate JSON messages?
	- XML and JSON as separate messages, but need to reference each other?
	- Linked data between JSON and XML NIEM-conforming messages?
- Or just that JSON messages can reference JSON standards?
- Just a URI to point?

- Related: Enabling contributors to submit suggest content in a JSON format
	- JSON Schema or JSON instance as example?
