## Revised NIEM release schedule

* NTAC is proposing a revised schedule for NIEM releases to replace the former three-year major / minor / minor cycle.

* Major release (for example, NIEM 7.0)

  - Can change the technical architecture
  - Can make breaking change to NIEM Core (remove a component, make material change to a component definition)
  - Evaluate need for a major release every 5 years; proceed when need and resources exist

* Core update

  - Can make non-breaking change to core
  - Domain model updates are optional
  - When needed

* Domain updates

  - Can include breaking and non-breaking change
  - Domains can coordinate for cross-domain harmonization
  - When needed

* This schedule is supported by a version management change:  

  - Namespace identifier changes *only* with a breaking change
  - Non-breaking change handled by a new @version attribute

* Schedule proposal was approved, will be briefed at 4 December PGB meeting.
